# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains the Phase 3 Machine Learning Classification project. The project focuses on predicting customer churn using different machine learning models and visualizing the results.

##  Project Summary:
Customer churn analysis is a crucial aspect of business decision-making. This project explores the application of machine learning classification models to predict customer churn based on historical data.

### Steps in the Project:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared data for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used Tableau for visual insights.
3. **Model Training:** Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and other models.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Conclusions & Recommendations:** Provided actionable insights to reduce churn.

##  Key Findings & Insights:
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of **85.7%** but had low recall for churned customers.
- Decision Tree performed better with **93.8% accuracy**, improving recall on churned customers.
- Data visualization in Tableau revealed key patterns in churn behavior.

##  Recommendations:
1.Improve Customer Support-we have observed that customers with an International Plan have a higher churn rate so we should Improve customer service response time and resolution effectiveness to prevent frustration.​

2.Personalized Retention Offers- Decision Tree model identified key churn patterns therefore we should use predictive analytics to offer targeted retention incentives (discounts, personalized plans) for customers predicted to churn.​

3.Focus on High-Risk Customers-Customers with an International Plan have a higher churn rate therefore we would recommend that we offer discounts or loyalty programs for customers on international plans to retain them.​
